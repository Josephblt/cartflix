# Design Notes

Cartflix is the app. Carty is the agent.

The first implementation should keep those responsibilities separate:

- Cartflix owns storage, validation, and the user interface.
- Carty interprets requests and proposes or performs allowed list operations.
- The data model should stay small enough to understand without a framework.

## Initial Shape
